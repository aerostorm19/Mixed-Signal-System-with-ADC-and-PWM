## Project Overview

This project implements a **mixed-signal system** using Intel’s MAX10 FPGA on the DE10-Lite board. It integrates analog voltage sensing via the on-chip ADC and digital control through a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) circuit. Designed as part of CU Boulder’s FPGA Capstone sequence, the system demonstrates analog input acquisition, signal processing, and LED-based feedback.

- Using Quartus Prime Lite Edition for complete FPGA design flow.
- Designing and simulating a PWM control system.
- Integrating on-chip ADC blocks and reading analog voltage levels.
- Creating custom hardware subsystems with Qsys (Platform Designer).
- Performing timing analysis and waveform simulation with ModelSim.
- Documenting all development steps and observations in a formal lab notebook.
